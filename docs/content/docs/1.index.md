# Introduction

When building a web extension, communication between all pieces of the extension is essential, but complicated. Every browser is slightly different and targeting where to send your message is complicated. This package provides a simple, consistent API for sending messages between the different parts of your web extension, such as `background`, `content-script`, `devtools`, `popup`, `options`, and `window` contexts. 

This pacakge is production ready. We know, because we use it in [Bugflow](https://bugflow.io). While building our extension, we also wrote our book, ["The Easiest Guide to Building Browser Extensions"](https://serversideup.net/building-multi-platform-browser-extensions/) which highlights this package and shows a variety of in-context use cases.

This project was originally started by <a href="https://github.com/zikaari" target="_blank" class="underline">Neek Sandhu (@zikaari)</a> in 2017. Unfortunately time became a constraint and in January 2024, the project was graciously transferred to Server Side Up to be maintained. We're very grateful for Neek Sandhu’s contributions and we're excited to carry the torch forward. 🤝

Let's get this package installed!
