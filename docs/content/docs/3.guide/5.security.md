# Security

The following note only applies if and only if, you will be sending/receiving messages to/from `window` contexts. There's no security concern if you will be only working with `content-script`, `background`, `popup`, `offscreen`, `options`, or `devtools` scope, which is the default setting.

`window` context(s) in tab `A` get unlocked the moment you call `allowWindowMessaging(namespace)` somewhere in your extension's content script(s) that's also loaded in tab `A`.

Unlike `chrome.runtime.sendMessage` and `chrome.runtime.connect`, which requires extension's manifest to specify sites allowed to talk with the extension, `webext-bridge` has no such measure by design, which means any webpage whether you intended or not, can do `sendMessage(msgId, data, 'background')` or something similar that produces same effect, as long as it uses same protocol used by `webext-bridge` and namespace set to same as yours.

So to be safe, if you will be interacting with `window` contexts, treat `webext-bridge` as you would treat `window.postMessage` API. Before you call `allowWindowMessaging`, check if that page's `window.location.origin` is something you expect already.

If you plan on having something critical, **always** verify the `sender` before responding:

```javascript
import { onMessage, isInternalEndpoint } from "webext-bridge/background";

onMessage("getUserBrowsingHistory", (message) => {
    const { data, sender } = message;

    // Respond only if request is from 'devtools', 'content-script', 'popup', 'offscreen', 'options', or 'background' endpoint
    if (isInternalEndpoint(sender)) {
        const { range } = data;
        return getHistory(range);
    }
});
```
